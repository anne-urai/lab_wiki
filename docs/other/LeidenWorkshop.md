# Psychology of social change workshop
Organisers: [Sara Constantino](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/people/sara-constantino) (Stanford University) & [Anne Urai](https://anneurai.net/) (Leiden University)

### Description
Climate action requires individual behavior change and collective mobilization, but we lack a clear understanding of how people's beliefs about social change influence their decisions to act. How do people perceive social change—and how do these perceptions shape their willingness to act? Moreover, we will explore how  psychological theories of social change perception can benefit from formal modelling approaches, developed in mathematical psychology and network science.

This workshop brings together researchers working at the intersection of environmental and social psychology; computational modelling of individual and collective decision-making; and network and complexity science. We aim for this workshop to be the start of more connections within the Dutch and international research community on these topics, ideally leading to future collaborations.
