# Psychology of social change workshop
Organisers: [Sara Constantino](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/people/sara-constantino) (Stanford University) & [Anne Urai](https://anneurai.net/) (Leiden University)

### Description
Developing (formal) psychological and cognitive theories to understand and characterize the mechanisms underlying social change, e.g. social tipping dynamics. Using this information to help inform the design of interventions aimed at creating broad social change, for instance applied to sustainability and climate action.

We envision this meeting will bring together researchers from cognitive (neuro)science, social psychology, behavioral science and social modelling to explore joint interests and (inter)national collaborative networks.
