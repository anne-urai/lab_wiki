# Psychology of social change workshop
Organisers: [Anne Urai](https://anneurai.net/) (Leiden University), [Sara Constantino](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/people/sara-constantino) (Stanford University), Fabian Dablander (University of Amsterdam), Jan Willem Bolderdijk (University of Amsterdam), Vitor Vasconcelos (University of Amsterdam)

### Description
Developing (formal) psychological and cognitive theories to understand and characterize the mechanisms underlying social change, e.g. social tipping dynamics. Using this information to help inform the design of interventions aimed at creating broad social change, for instance applied to sustainability and climate action.

We envision this meeting will bring together researchers from cognitive (neuro)science, social psychology, behavioral science and social modelling to explore joint interests and (inter)national collaborative networks.
