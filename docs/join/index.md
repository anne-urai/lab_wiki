If you interested in the lab's research, please check out recent publications and think about a project that fits with the lab's scientific focus. Make sure to read the pages about my vision on supervision and academic values (and the rest of the lab wiki), and think about the mentorship style that suits you.

# PhD / postdoc
I'm always interested in discussing project ideas for PhD or postdoc candidates. However, you need grant or fellowship funding. As is typical in Europe, PhD students are mostly allocated to already-funded projects. 

If you’d like to work with me, please send me 
1.  your CV including references, 
2. a motivation letter including ideas for a research direction or project, and 
3. options for funding such you'd like to apply for (see a list of funding options on the wiki).
If it is a good fit, I will collaborate on your research plan and write a letter of support.


# MSc / BSc / BA students

If you're a student at Leiden University, or want to visit as an exchange student, please send me 
1. your CV, including information about your study program and your experience in programming and data analysis, 
2. when and how long you'd like to do a project, 
3. letter of motivation: what topics interest you, and what project would you be interested in (see here for inspiration).


### Interested in joining?

If you're interested in doing a project with us, great! Check out the following before you begin:
- [our values](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/Vision.html), including some expectation management.
- [project ideas](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/ProjectIdeas.html).

Once you've gone through those and have tried the exercises, let me know how things went (and where/if you got stuck) and what research questions you'd like to pursue.
