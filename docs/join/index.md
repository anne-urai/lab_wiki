If you interested in the lab's research, please check out recent publications and think about a project that fits with the lab's scientific focus. Make sure to read the pages about my vision on supervision and academic values (and the rest of the lab wiki). I invite you to speak to current or past lab members about life in the lab, and my mentorship style.

# PhD / postdoc
Doing a PhD has many [benefits](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.81075) but can also be [tough love](https://neurochambers.blogspot.com/2012/05/tough-love-insensitive-guide-to.html). If you are considering a PhD, read [these guidelines](https://www.cameronbrick.com/should-i-get-a-phd) first.

I'm always interested in discussing project ideas for PhD or postdoc candidates. However, you need grant or fellowship funding: vacancies in the Netherlands occur mostly through projects, not through a PhD program or university scholarships. Exceptions are scholarships through external foundations that finance your PhD (which are categorized as external PhDs). 

If you’d like to work with me, please send me 
1. your CV including references, 
2. a motivation letter including ideas for a research direction or project, _and_ 
3. options for funding such you'd like to apply for (see a list of funding options on the wiki).

If it is a good fit, I will collaborate on your research plan and write a letter of support.

## Visiting students
For shorter visits, the focus of your project should be closely aligned with that of a current lab member who can serve as your daily supervisor. Check out the current list of lab members, and feel free to contact them, to see if there is a good match.

# MSc / BSc / BA students
I normally accept students through the ACP MSc and the Psychology RM at Leiden University.

If you're a student at Leiden University, or want to visit as an exchange student, please send me 
1. your CV, including information about your study program and your experience in programming and data analysis, 
2. when and how long you'd like to do a project, 
3. letter of motivation: what topics interest you, and what project would you be interested in.

See a specific section on expectations for students in _Lab culture_.
