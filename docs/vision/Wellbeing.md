# Well-being
Take care of yourself: research can be exhausting ([and a lot like learning how to surf](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1451547079076106250.html)). As [Weiji Ma](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/events/growingupinscience/index.html) has said: we're professional doubters, so doubting ourselves is a real occupational hazard. A certain amount of [impostor syndrome](https://medium.com/the-spike/why-scientists-feel-dumb-2ed0ac869b1f) is normal, and you will almost certainly find yourself in [the valley of shit](https://thesiswhisperer.com/2012/05/08/the-valley-of-shit/) at some point.
Research can be tedious, frustrating and boring, scientific setbacks are normal, and peer review can be downright hostile. Don't let those define your sense of self-worth: you are not your job! 

To stay sane and grounded, remember you're [a whole person](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-awesomest-7-year-postdoc-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-tenure-track-faculty-life/): don't neglect your life outside the lab. Spend time building and maintaining relationships, both inside and outside science: while enthusiasm over results, paper and grants will fade over time, your peers and friends will not. This [podcast episode](https://braininspired.co/podcast/100-1/) has great advice on career satisfaction and well-being.

If you struggle with mental health, know that you're not alone, and that resources are available. Leiden University has [counsellors](https://www.student.universiteitleiden.nl/en/study--studying/guidance--advice/study-guidance-and-advisors/confidential-counsellors/social-and-behavioural-sciences/psychology-bsc?cf=social-and-behavioural-sciences&cd=psychology-bsc) and [student psychologist services](https://www.student.universiteitleiden.nl/en/study--studying/guidance--advice/study-guidance-and-advisors/student-psychologist/social-and-behavioural-sciences/psychology-bsc?cf=social-and-behavioural-sciences&cd=psychology-bsc) that you can use freely and confidentially. [Frisse gedachten](https://www.frissegedachtes.nl/) provides low-threshold chats and buddy-systems in Dutch. You can always talk to me about any professional or personal circumstances, for advice, or to point out ways in which I should improve/change my ways.

See [here](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/social-behavioural-sciences/graduate-school-of-social-and-behavioural-sciences/current-phd-candidates/phd-support) for an overview page with all resources available to Leiden University PhD students.

# Reporting misconduct 
Bullying, harassment and misconduct are [unacceptable](https://www.staff.universiteitleiden.nl/vr/social-and-behavioural-sciences/teacher-platform-fsw/teaching--supporting-the-learning-process/diversity-and-inclusion/fsw-code-of-conduct?cf=social-and-behavioural-sciences&cd=psychology). If you witness or are subjected to anything that may fit their description, then tell [someone who can do something](https://www.staff.universiteitleiden.nl/human-resources/social-safety?cf=social-and-behavioural-sciences&cd=psychology).

The following four routes can be taken if someone experiences bullying and harassment:
1. Talk to your PI and/or lab members: for less severe cases or if one wants to first have an informal chat about incidences, please bring up issues and questions with the lab. Often, an open and honest conversation early on can clarify much more than waiting until things get worse.
2. If you'd rather talk with someone outside the lab, contact the Unit chair (Guido Band) or the unit's PhD/postdoc representative (listed in the [CogPsy wiki](https://leidenuniv1.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/WorkingatCognitivePsychology/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC4830FD4-6B03-4DE6-A3BE-26EE87D5F27D%7D&file=WIKI%20Cognitive%20Psychology.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)).
3. For PhD students, the [FSW graduate school](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/social-behavioural-sciences/graduate-school-of-social-and-behavioural-sciences) has mentors and people you can connect with.
4. At the level of the faculty and university, there are many [resources](https://www.staff.universiteitleiden.nl/human-resources/social-safety?cf=social-and-behavioural-sciences&cd=psychology): confidential counselors, ombuds officers,and procedures.
