I encourage all lab members to seek and apply for training opportunities to develop new expertise. This is often at conferences, but can also be through research visits (e.g. with collaborators) or by giving invited talks.

Each postdoc and PhD student has a standard budget (see CogPsy wiki) per year to travel and attend conferences; individual funding and grant situations may change this somewhat. Typically, I expect both PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to attend a competitive training school and/or a conference by the end of their second year in the lab. Make sure to discuss your plans, and ask Anne for information on travel cost reimbursements.

Master's or BSc students are also encouraged to attend conferences if they have work to present - please discuss plans with me in advance.

# Conferences
I normally go to the Dutch [NVP](https://www.societyforbrainandcognition.nl/) (more cognitive) or [DNM](https://dnm22.azuleon.org/) (more neuro) meetings in person, and to the virtual NeuroMatch conferences. Depending on your career stage and interests, you can consider attending [FENS](https://fensforum.org/), [SfN](https://www.sfn.org/), [ECVP](https://ecvp.eu/), [ASSC](https://theassc.org/), CCN, [Cosyne](https://www.cosyne.org/), [CogSci](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/).

[The Transmitter](https://www.thetransmitter.org/events/) keeps a great overview of neuroscience meetings.

## Smaller meetings
- [Society for the Biology of Decision Making](https://sbdm2023.sciencesconf.org/)
- [Bernstein Conference](https://bernstein-network.de/en/bernstein-conference/bernstein-conference-2024/)

## Summer schools
I strongly encourage students and postdocs to attend at least one summer school.
