My publishing philosophy is that lab members generally have one main high-quality project. For postdocs, this will usually mean one main paper, with potential smaller co-authored papers or side projects. For a PhD thesis, it is common to include 3 empirical chapters (of which ideally one or two are submitted/accepted) by graduation.

# How to write scientific papers

For your first version and submission, do not bother with citation formats, word counts and layout of specific journals: write what you want to say ('your paper, your way'). We will deal with journal specifics later in the process.

See this useful [writing guide](https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0497-22.2022) by Matteo Carandini. 
- [Tips on writing good paper titles](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1530688927790661632.html).
- [The shortest ever guide to academic writing](http://neuroanatody.com/2023/07/the-shortest-ever-guide-to-academic-writing/).
- [Writing in an accessible manner](https://www.the100.ci/2024/12/01/writing-about-technical-topics-in-an-accessible-manner/).
- To write well, read your writing out loud. Every first sentence of a paragraph should summarize it (see the guidelines by Matteo Carandini)

Practice version control; I like Google Docs to avoid conflicts and unclarity about versioning, and it works well with Zotero. Make sure to name important versions of the manuscript like 'preprint_v1'. However, if you prefer another system, I'm happy to be convinced.

## Before submitting a preprint/paper with me
Send all co-authors an email with the following:
- Final paper draft that has been approved by all co-authors
- Journal & preprint server this will be submitted to
- Reviewers to suggest
- Link to public data
- Link to public code. Has the code been [reviewed](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/iblgovernance/blob/main/IBL%20Code%20Reproducibility%20Policy.pdf)? 

Note: **I must be able to _reproduce all figures_ from your public data and code before submission.**

# I'm a sucker for *nice-looking figures* (and fonts)
Learn how to make your figures look good straight out of Python/Matlab/Julia/R, and minimize the time spent changing things in Illustrator/InkScape. This will not only save a lot of time in the long run, it also makes your analyses more reproducible. 

**[Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10fEmdswbj4zGy01kwoDrOmCLhbA0MqdFu4oynzw473Y/edit#slide=id.p)** are slides of a _figure workshop_ we did in lab meeting on 26 February 2024. Watch back the [recording](https://video.leidenuniv.nl/media/t/1_j5544njq) when you're starting to make your own figures!

Ideally, follow this [IBL styleguide](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/ibl-style) for consistent and good-looking figures. This [starting guide to Illustrator by Arjun Raj](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TXmbltzBPcApCcuJ9HLOIQgWPqKylrFRWRudrN-5vBE/edit?tab=t.0) is super helpful, especially on keeping images linked until you are ready to submit. I recommend following [this procedure](https://bsky.app/profile/guidomeijer.com/post/3m3cdjoedfk2l).

# Authorship
It is unfortunate that [we don't talk about authorship](https://medium.com/@ashleyjthinks/no-one-wants-to-talk-about-authorship-d0156307aa50) [(early) enough](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7312/juav19088-015/html).  While I have [some opinions](https://tobiasdonner.net/our-labs-take-on-authorship/), we should discuss authorship for each project. The [Leiden University psychology](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/binaries/content/assets/sociale-wetenschappen/psychologie/organisatiegids/ib-ip-fsw-16-12-2019-leiden-university-institute-of-psychology-authorship-guidelines.pdf) guidelines should be leading for any authorship list we settle on, but it still leaves a lot open. Ultimately, I may want to settle on a policy [like this](https://kosslynlab.fas.harvard.edu/files/kosslynlab/files/authorship_criteria_nov02.pdf).
- Scientific autorship is a tricky business (see [here](https://tobiasdonner.net/our-labs-take-on-authorship/) for discussion in my PhD lab). I aim to discuss authorship early on, clarify expectations, and give regular updates when a project changes. If you are unsure about authorship, please let me know asap.
- I aim to have an honest authorship discussion at the moment a project looks like it might become a paper (this is not necessarily always the case when we work together, for instance when you do a short student internship). 
- Early on, we will try to settle on an initial authorship order that everybody is happy with, and clarify the expectations of everyone in the group. When the work changes, new people come on board or someone leaves, we should discuss again. Ideally, we discuss authorship expectations at every 6-month review meeting.
- If you feel unsure about authorship, _bring it up asap_:  I much prefer to have an early discussion and avoid later misunderstandings or frustration. 
- Whatever authorship scheme we settle on, I encourage using the [Credit scheme](https://credit.niso.org/) with additional detail to keep track of everybody's contributions. Ideally, we add this statement to the preprint/paper together with a clear [tabular visualization](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/paper-behavior/blob/master/authorship/IBL%20behavior%20platform%20paper%20-%20contribution%20statement.ipynb).
- Apart from traditional authorship order, we will indicate each person's contributions to the project in a tabular form (inspired by [Nick Steinmetz](https://t.co/R5hQiSYvKt?amp=1), further develop in [IBL](https://iiif.elifesciences.org/lax:63711%2Felife-63711-fig6-v2.tif/full/1500,/0/default.jpg)).

# Journals
My goal is to preprint all work (on e.g. bioRxiv or PsyArxiv) before sending it out to publication. Good scientific practice, as well as funding mandates, mean that we will favour Open Access publishing. I find it difficult to formulate standard rules about journal choice, and I will aim to discuss with the project team when we are starting to write the paper.

# Revisions
General wisdom about paper revisions: https://ahappyphd.org/posts/revising/

- Follow [Stefano Palminteri's guidelines](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/kyfus) for preparing your rebuttal letter.
- See [this rebuttal](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fncomms14637/MediaObjects/41467_2017_BFncomms14637_MOESM2317_ESM.pdfhttps://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fncomms14637/MediaObjects/41467_2017_BFncomms14637_MOESM2317_ESM.pdf) to my first paper for a format to follow.
