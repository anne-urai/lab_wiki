# Reading and thinking

Read widely, deeply and regularly. Read weird things. 

Below is a link to a selection of books that are not strictly related to my scientific work, but have profoundly shaped me as a person.

{: .highlight-title }
> Important advice by Sam Gershman
>
> Everyone wants to work on topics that are cool using methods that are cool. This means those topics and methods are going to be crowded. You’ll worry about getting scooped. People are less generous with one another when they’re competing.
> 
> It’s hard to find puzzles that people care about but nonetheless aren’t working on. One heuristic is to look at areas where people aren’t using strong inference because their theoretical ideas aren’t well formulated. A well-formulated theory is worth a million experiments.
>
> Being uncool requires courage and creativity. Read outside your specialty. Read poetry, novels, philosophy, history. Take long walks and talk to madmen wherever you can find them. 

## Keeping track of the literature
Keep track of what you read, and make notes; I strongly recommend Zotero for managing both pdfs and references. If you login with your Leiden FSW account, Zotero has unlimited free storage space for PDFs.

[This](https://fraserlab.com/philosophy/rss_how_to/) is a useful framework for using RSS feeds to collect journal feeds and custom keyword feeds. I use a similar approach, with a combination of journals, blogs and keywords going to my Feedly (this keeps my email inbox relatively free from newsletters).

[Here](https://www.cameronbrick.com/literature-search) is a useful overview by Cameron Brick on how to stay on top of the literature.

The [Leiden University Library](https://www.library.universiteitleiden.nl/searching-sources/tools) has useful tools to easily access the literature.
