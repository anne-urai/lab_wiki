# Before you arrive
See [this](https://www.staff.universiteitleiden.nl/human-resources/new-staff?cf=social-and-behavioural-sciences&cd=psychology) and [this page](https://www.medewerkers.universiteitleiden.nl/po/international-staff?cf=sociale-wetenschappen&cd=psychologie) for lots of resources for international staff at the university. This [beginner's guide to Dutch academia](https://knaw.h5mag.com/beginners-guide/introduction) is helpful to better understand the broader national context.

# Getting started
- **University-level**
    - When your contract starts, you will get a LU account (email address, card for printing/library etc) through Eva Potters.
    - See [these resources](https://www.staff.universiteitleiden.nl/research/phds/support-and-community/social-and-behavioural-sciences/psychology?cf=social-and-behavioural-sciences&cd=psychology) for connecting with other PhD students and postdocs in the university.
- **Unit (aka department)-level**
    - Ask secretary [Eva Potters](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/eva-potters#tab-1) to be added to the _FSW - Cogpsy_ mailing list. 
    - The _Working in Cognitive Psychology_ Teams channel is important to connect with the department, and has a good [wiki](https://leidenuniv1.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/WorkingatCognitivePsychology/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC4830FD4-6B03-4DE6-A3BE-26EE87D5F27D%7D&file=WIKI%20Cognitive%20Psychology.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) with a lot of department-related information, including a **manual for newcomers** and information on who is who.
    - Eva can also help you with desks, keys, [computer hardware](https://www.staff.universiteitleiden.nl/ict/ict-workplace/hardware/desktops-and-laptops/social-and-behavioural-sciences/psychology?cf=social-and-behavioural-sciences&cd=psychology), etc.
        - __Note__: Once you get a university laptop (talk to Anne before ordering it, to make sure we get you something useful) request it to switch to ['semi-managed'](https://helpdesk.universiteitleiden.nl/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=2c19d2f22cde4c509ff4958b173a2fba). Without doing this, you won't be able to install much software. Ask Anne how to best do this.
- **Lab-level**
    - Anne will add you to the Google lab calendar (where you can see lab events, talks etc).
    - Anne will add you to the _CoCoSys lab teams_. This is the main communication channel for the lab, where we also store shared files: posters, templates, forms.
    - We will schedule an onboarding session, specifically to together write our _Mentoring agreement together_, ideally in the first weeks of you joining the lab.
    - Familiarize yourself with the contents of this wiki, and tell me how it can be improved!

## Useful mailing lists, groups etc
- Many Teams channels have useful information. I regularly check the _Open Science Community Leiden_, _Sustainability network_, and _Psychology Living Room_ MS teams groups. 
- Community email lists:
    - CCN-NL for cogneuro
    - Brick-lab for environmental psychology
- IBL Slack for internal IBL things (ask Anne about onboarding if you'll work with internal IBL data).

# Working time, on-site working and meetings
I expect all lab members to be in the office at least 3 days a week (often Mon/Tues/Thurs), during regular office hours (~10:00-17:00). 

Discussing scientific progress is essential for the success of our projects. I expect all lab members to actively participate in our scheduled meetings: 
1. On Monday or Tuesday (see Gcal for the lab), our own CoCoSys lab meeting
2. On Thursday, the [weekly CogPsy meeting](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/Practical.html) and _CO-squared_ joint lab meeting.


For longer projects (PhD/postdoc), 


Yearly
- writing week in Academy building
- team outings


I am committed to creating a healthy work environment for all lab members. I anticipate all lab members taking a minimum of [institution’s] prescribed days of annual leave. “Minimum” because if experiments/conferences necessitate working on a weekend, I support lab members taking time off to compensate. I hope to schedule all meetings within [institution’s] “core” work hours, and will refrain from sending, or answering, non-urgent emails/messages outside of work hours.

All full-time lab members should aim to work onsite at least four days a week. I expect this number to reduce (probably to "three") once the lab is operational and more time is being spent analysing data rather than building rigs/training mice. In general, I believe that some regular onsite presence is important to maintain the lab community. However, I am happy to support intermittent periods of fully-remote working when, for example, traveling/visiting family abroad or writing up a thesis/grant.

# Project logs and management
Get organized: my setup is Zotero for papers, Obsidian for notes/planning, MS Teams for quick communication.
 
In general, every lab member/project will keep track in two ways:
1. Inspired by the [Voytek lab](https://voyteklab.com/management/git/publications/lab-management/), make a core GitHub repository (pick a useful, descriptive name) for your project and add `anne-urai` as a collaborator (feel free to keep it private). Then, add a [GitHub project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project) where we can start to list all ideas and plans as issues. At each meeting, we'll review the project status and make plans.
2. A running 'meeting notes' document, or 

## Language
The lab language is English. Any professional conversation, oral and written, during work activities must be in English: these include presentations and discussion at lab meetings, scientific output, and email exchanges. The institutional language at Leiden University and in the Cognitive Psychology Unit is English; nonetheless, many administrative exchanges and Dutch bureaucracy are still in Dutch. 

## Practicalities
- poster printing
- room booking: Olthoff room, other rooms in FSW faculty, academy building
- setup for hybrid lab meetings

### Booking a room at Leiden Uni
- lecture hall somewhere in the university: email the [ServiceDesk](https://www.medewerkers.universiteitleiden.nl/gebouwen-faciliteiten/gebouwen/zaal-reserveren?cf=sociale-wetenschappen&cd=psychologie) of every faculty separately (there is no uni-wide system).
- nice workshop space: [Lorentz Center](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/calendar.html). When there are no workshops, Leiden Uni staff can make use of the space.
- common room in PdlC building: in Outlook web calendar, simply create an event and select 'Psychology Common Room' as the location. 
- Olthoff room (CogPsy) for up to 8 ppl: in Outlook web calendar, create an event and select 'Olthoff room' as the location. 

# Leaving the lab
People leave the lab for all kinds of reasons, whether after several PhD years, or after a summer project. Hopefully, they are leaving for exciting new opportunities. Regardless of the reason for leaving, please give Anne as much notice as possible so that this transition can take place as smoothly.

## Offboarding checklist
- Inform the CogPsy secretariat of formal end to your contract, and indicate if your account should be extended as a guest (to keep access to e.g. library access, MS teams access, data stored on internal servers)
- Go over personal folders for data/code: cleanup, comment, and commit. Share with Anne all remaining data/code that has not yet been published.
- Document workflows, protocols, or specific responsibilities.
- Return any physical keys to CogPsy secretariat.
- Schedule [exit interview](https://github.com/SAFE-Labs-Docs/Lab-Handbook/tree/main/3-CAREERS/08-Leaving-The-Lab) to review time in the lab, give mutual feedback, and discuss future plans.
