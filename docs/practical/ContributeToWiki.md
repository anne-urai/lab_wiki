I'm always looking to improve these instructions. Please help me, and let me know which ones are unclear, if links don't work, or if you've found better resources/additional information that can help students in the future.

### Contributing to this wiki
1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/anne-urai/lab_wiki).
2. Clone your own fork to local
3. Edit existing `.md` files, or create new ones. See [here](https://just-the-docs.com/) for instructions on how to ensure these show up correctly in the menu.
4. Add, commit and push to your fork
5. Create a PR: go to Pull Requests / New / Compare across forks and select your fork. Explain what you've added, and why.
6. I'll incorporate your edits in the wiki.
