### Meetings
- Cognitive Psychology colloquia are held at 16.00 on Thursdays. Email [Julia Folz](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/medewerkers/julia-folz#tab-1) if you're interested in receiving weekly invitations.
- We meet once a month with a smaller group interested in computational modelling. Email [Selin Topel](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/selin-topel#tab-1) to get on the mailing list.
- The lab meets weekly; see lab calendar for times.
- I intend to have weekly meetings with PhD students and postdocs; for Master students, see the guidelines on BrightSpace.

#### Booking a room at Leiden Uni
- lecture hall somewhere in the university: email the [ServiceDesk](https://www.medewerkers.universiteitleiden.nl/gebouwen-faciliteiten/gebouwen/zaal-reserveren?cf=sociale-wetenschappen&cd=psychologie) of every faculty separately (there is no uni-wide system).
- nice workshop space: [Lorentz Center](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/calendar.html). When there are no workshops, Leiden Uni staff can make use of the space.
- common room in PdlC building: in Outlook web calendar, simply create an event and select 'Psychology Common Room' as the location. 
- Olthoff room (CogPsy) for up to 8 ppl: there is a paper calendar at the secretariat.

### Conferences
Feel free to explore meetings and conferences, and discuss where you'd like to go! 

I normally go to the Dutch [NVP](https://www.societyforbrainandcognition.nl/) (more cognitive) or [DNM](https://dnm22.azuleon.org/) (more neuro) meetings in person, and to the virtual NeuroMatch conferences. Depending on your career stage and interests, you can consider attending [FENS](https://fensforum.org/), [SfN](https://www.sfn.org/), [ECVP](https://ecvp.eu/), [ASSC](https://theassc.org/), CCN, [Cosyne](https://www.cosyne.org/), [CogSci](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/).

[The Transmitter](https://www.thetransmitter.org/events/) keeps a great overview of neuroscience meetings.

#### Smaller meetings
- [Society for the Biology of Decision Making](https://sbdm2023.sciencesconf.org/)
- [Bernstein Conference](https://bernstein-network.de/en/bernstein-conference/bernstein-conference-2024/)

### Summer schools
I strongly encourage students and postdocs to attend at least one summer school.

- Rauischolzhausen, vision science
- CSHL, vision science
- Neuromatch Academy
- Barcelona behavioral modelling
- Nencki School of Ideas, Poland
- Mathematical Methods in Computational Neurosciences, Norway
- [Cajal course in computational neuroscience](https://cajal-training.org/on-site/computational-neuroscience-2024/)

### Laptop
Once you get a university laptop (talk to Anne before ordering it, to make sure we get you something useful) request it to switch to ['semi-managed'](https://helpdesk.universiteitleiden.nl/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=2c19d2f22cde4c509ff4958b173a2fba). Without doing this, you won't be able to install much software. Ask Anne how to best do this.
