# Before you arrive
- See [this page](https://www.medewerkers.universiteitleiden.nl/po/international-staff?cf=sociale-wetenschappen&cd=psychologie) for lots of resources for international staff at the university.

# Getting started
- **University-level**: get an LU account (email address, card for printing/library etc). 
- **Unit (aka department)-level**: ask secretary [Eva Potters](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/eva-potters#tab-1) to be added to the _FSW - Cogpsy_ mailing list. 
    - The _Working in Cognitive Psychology_ Teams channel is important to connect with the department, and has a good wiki with a lot of department-related information, including a **manual for newcomers** and information on who is who.
    - Eva can also help you with desks, keys, computer hardware, etc.
- **Lab-level**: Anne will add you to the Google lab calendar (where you can see lab events, talks etc) and the _CoCoSys lab teams_. This is the main communication channel for the lab, where we also store shared files: posters, templates, forms.

## Useful mailing lists, groups etc
- Many Teams channels have useful information. I regularly check the _Open Science Community Leiden_, _Sustainability network_, and _Psychology Living Room_ MS teams groups. 
- Community email lists:
    - CCN-NL for cogneuro
    - Brick-lab for environmental psychology
- IBL Slack for internal IBL things (ask Anne about onboarding if you'll work with internal IBL data).

# Project logs and management
Get organized: my setup is Zotero for papers, Obsidian for notes/planning, MS Teams for quick communication.

Inspired by the [Voytek lab](https://voyteklab.com/management/git/publications/lab-management/), make a core GitHub repository (pick a useful, descriptive name) for your project and add `anne-urai` as a collaborator (feel free to keep it private). Then, add a [GitHub project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project) where we can start to list all ideas and plans as issues. At each meeting, we'll review the project status and make plans.

# Meetings and on-site working
We have the following standard meetings, which I in principle expect you to attend:
1. our own CoCoSys lab meeting (normally Mon/Tues)
2. 

Please join the [weekly CogPsy meeting](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/Practical.html) and weekly lab meeting (ask Anne for access to lab calendar), and feel free to suggest topics/papers.

For Bachelor/Master student projects, I normally start with **meetings on demand**: when you either get stuck or have something to show me (one of these should happen every few weeks), book a meeting through Calendly and send me a short description beforehand. 
For longer projects (PhD/postdoc), we'll start with regular meetings (e.g. once a week, once every two weeks). Talk to me and find out what works for you.

Before our weekly supervision meetings, fill out this [template](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/MeetingTemplate.html) to help us structure our discussion. Afterwards, email the action points we agreed on. Most meetings shouldn't be longer than 45 minutes to an hour; but of course if we need more time/relaxed atmosphere, let me know.
