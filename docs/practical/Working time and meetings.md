# Working time, on-site working and meetings
I am committed to creating a healthy work environment for all lab members. I encourage all lab members taking a minimum of [Leiden University's prescribed days of vacation](https://www.staff.universiteitleiden.nl/human-resources/conditions-of-employment-salary-and-allowance/leave/annual-leave/social-and-behavioural-sciences/psychology?cf=social-and-behavioural-sciences&cd=psychology), whether or not you are officially employed by the university.

I aim to schedule all meetings within regular work hours, and will refrain from sending, or answering, non-urgent emails/messages outside of work hours.

I expect all lab members to be in the office at least 3 days a week (often Mon/Tues/Thurs), during regular office hours (~10:00-17:00). If you are away or working remotely, please inform me and note this in the lab calendar. In general, I believe that some regular onsite presence is important to maintain the lab community. However, I am happy to support intermittent periods of fully-remote working when, for example, traveling/visiting family abroad or writing up a thesis/grant - please discuss with me, and make sure we document expectations (e.g. in a mentoring agreement).

Discussing scientific progress is essential for the success of our projects. I expect all lab members to actively participate in our scheduled meetings: 
1. On Monday or Tuesday (see Gcal for the lab), our own CoCoSys lab meeting
2. On Thursday, the [weekly CogPsy meeting](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/Practical.html) and _CO-squared_ joint lab meeting.

#### Additional meetings
- For climate psychology: Cameron Brick's lab meeting is often on Zoom, as well as the NYU climate psychology working group (sign up for their mailing lists).
- For social psychology: the [Social, Economic and Organisational Psychology unit is useful for some climate-related topics. Ask [Tycho](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/tycho-van-tartwijk#tab-1) to be added.

Every semester (2x/year), we also aim to have a writing week (often in Leiden's Academy Building) and a lab social/outing.

# Meeting templates
See the templates for mentoring agreement, weekly meetings, and evaluation meetings.

# Leaving the lab
People leave the lab for all kinds of reasons, whether after several PhD years, or after a summer project. Hopefully, they are leaving for exciting new opportunities. Regardless of the reason for leaving, please give Anne as much notice as possible so that this transition can take place as smoothly.

## Offboarding checklist
- Inform the CogPsy secretariat of formal end to your contract, and indicate if your account should be extended as a guest (to keep access to e.g. library access, MS teams access, data stored on internal servers)
- Go over personal folders for data/code: cleanup, comment, and commit. Share with Anne all remaining data/code that has not yet been published.
- Document workflows, protocols, or specific responsibilities.
- Return any physical keys to CogPsy secretariat.
- Schedule [exit interview](https://github.com/SAFE-Labs-Docs/Lab-Handbook/tree/main/3-CAREERS/08-Leaving-The-Lab) to review time in the lab, give mutual feedback, and discuss future plans.
