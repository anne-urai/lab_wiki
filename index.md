### Welcome!
This is the lab wiki. For more info about our team, research, blog and publications see [anneurai.net](https://anneurai.net).

This wiki and lab manual is inspired by similar documents from [Mariam Aly](https://osf.io/mdh87/wiki/home/), [Trina MacMahon](https://d1uqjtzsuwlnsf.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/163/2016/11/McMahon_UW_Compact_Example.pdf), [Bray Voytek](https://voyteklab.com/philosophy) and [Michael Beyer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y1wzFVdp-FCoGM47okaW5eYdOOfpgXD5nM9Q7DpwAMo/edit). It's a continuous work in progress.

### Interested in joining?

If you're interested in doing a project with us, great! Check out the following before you begin:
- [our values](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/Vision.html), including some expectation management.
- [project ideas](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/ProjectIdeas.html).

Once you've gone through those and have tried the exercises, let me know how things went (and where/if you got stuck) and what research questions you'd like to pursue.

#### Choosing a scientific project
Read [Alon (2009)](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1097276509006418) and consider taking 3 months to scope the project, before starting!
