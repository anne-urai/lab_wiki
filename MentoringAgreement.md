---

This mentoring agreement has been adapted from [Yael Niv](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_RfH4f23_5n2cKxqoItRJBE8PrGkHfuO7w-6P701gr8/edit). 

## Mentoring agreement template

The purpose of this agreement is to assist in documenting mutually agreed upon goals and parameters that will serve as the foundation for our mentoring relationship. This agreement is expected to be a living document that is altered as needed throughout your time in the lab. 

1.  **Goals** _(what you hope to achieve as a result of this relationship, e.g., gain perspective relative to skills necessary for success in academia, explore new career opportunities/ alternatives, obtain knowledge of organizational culture, networking, leadership skill development)_

2.  **Steps to achieving goals as stated above** _(e.g., meeting regularly, manuscripts/grants, collaborating on research projects, steps to achieving independence). What assistance (specific/general) do you need with this?_

3. **What expectations does the mentee have of the mentor?**

4. **What expectations does the mentor have of the mentee?** See [Vision](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/Vision.html) and [Working with me](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/Working_with_me.html).

5. **Meeting frequency** _(frequency, duration, and location of meetings) and communication plan (emails, slack, etc.)_

6. **Any concerns the mentee wants discussed and resolved?**

7. **Any concerns the mentors want discussed and resolved?**

8. **How will you know when the mentoring relationship has served its purpose and needs to be re-evaluated, completed or teminated?**

9. **Plan for evaluating relationship effectiveness.** _(e.g., bi-annual review of mentorship meeting minutes, goals, and outcomes/accomplishments)_
  
10. **Any additional areas/issues you want to discuss?** _Any sensitive issues that we discuss will be held in the strictest of confidence. Issues that are off limits for discussion?_
