### Getting started in the lab
- See [this page](https://www.medewerkers.universiteitleiden.nl/po/international-staff?cf=sociale-wetenschappen&cd=psychologie) for lots of resources for international staff at the university.
- Get added to the Google lab calendar (ask Anne)
- Get added to the _CoCoSys lab MS teams group_ (ask Anne). This is where we ideally store shared files: posters, templates, forms, etc.
- Get added to the _Cognitive Psychology_, _Open Science Community Leiden_ and _Psychology Living Room_ MS teams groups. The _MS Teams_ group has a good wiki with a lot of department-related information, including a **manual for newcomers**. Make sure to check it out!
- Get organized: my setup is Zotero for papers, Obsidian for notes/planning, MS Teams for quick communication
- Read, and then **[contribute to this wiki](https://github.com/anne-urai/lab_wiki/ContributeToWiki.html)**

#### Project logs and management
Inspired by the [Voytek lab](https://voyteklab.com/management/git/publications/lab-management/), make a core GitHub repository (pick a useful, descriptive name) for your project and add `anne-urai` as a collaborator (feel free to keep it private). Then, add a [GitHub project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project) where we can start to list all ideas and plans as issues. At each meeting, we'll review the project status and make plans.

#### Getting started at the cognitive psychology unit
- ask secretary [Eva Potters](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/eva-potters#tab-1) to be added to the _FSW - Cogpsy_ mailing list. 

#### Choosing a scientific project
Read [Alon (2009)](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1097276509006418) and consider taking 3 months to scope the project, before starting!
