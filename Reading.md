Read widely, deeply and regularly. Read weird things. Keep track of what you read, and make notes; I strongly recommend Zotero with the Zotfile plugin for managing both pdfs and references.
[This](https://fraserlab.com/philosophy/rss_how_to/) is a useful framework for using RSS feeds to collect journal feeds and custom keyword feeds. I use a similar approach, with a combination of journals, blogs and keywords going to my Feedly (this keeps my email inbox relatively free of endless newsletters).
[Here](https://www.cameronbrick.com/literature-search) is a useful overview by Cameron Brick on how to stay on top of the literature.
 
 Some of my favorite papers and books:

## A guide for (research) master's students
#### Start collaboration
* If you want to learn more about current work at the lab, look into the recent projects [here](https://anneurai.net/research-interests/) or [here](https://anneurai.net/publications/)
* Reach out to the lab [here](https://anneurai.net/getting-started/) with a project idea
* Communicate your expectations and goals
#### You have an idea, but what then?
a) Sources for improving programming skills
* [Neural Data Science in Python](https://neuraldatascience.io/intro.html)
* [Neuromatch Computational Neuroscience Course](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html#)

b) Read literature
* Check the literature above
* If it is not enough, look for review articles on the topic

c) Communicate with your fellow lab members
* Especially if stuck with code

d) Track your progress
