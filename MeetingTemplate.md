# Weekly / regular meetings

_Note: if you feel like skipping the meeting, that's totally fine. If it's for scientific reasons (just discovered a bug in my code, model is still running on the cluster) let me know. If it's for personal reasons, you of course don't have to tell me the specifics._

## Template to fill out _before_ meeting
For our regular supervision meetings, we'll use the template below (feel free to adapt it to your needs, or give me feedback). It was adapted from [Tomas Knapen's lab wiki](https://github.com/tknapen/tknapen.github.io/wiki/Meeting-template), who in turn got it from Martin Hebart.

Fill it in before our meeting, and send it to Anne by email (just in the body of the text) with title _'Weekly summary [date]'_. If you have a better idea for keeping track (a shared living document? Teams channel?), I'm happy to explore!

### Current state of wellbeing
Motivation is pretty good / I'm demotivated because... / I have fun working on ... / Still trying to get over the paper rejection... / I'm struggling with ... / I'm bored / Insecure

### Past work
Describe the progress of the past week (or period since we last met), including longer descriptions (text, figures, code). Ideally, code + figures live in a shared GitHub repo or other document where I can look at them before we meet.

- Done, as planned
- Done, with some changes, due to ...
- Not done, since [insert problem]
- Something else came up

### Next steps
- These are the obvious next things I'll pursue
- I have a fantastic new idea for a new analysis that solves all our problems
- Based on our conversations, I want to try what you suggested 4 weeks ago but I never tried it...
- I'm stuck on ...

### What I need (from supervision) right now
Feel free to already send me some keywords or action points ahead of time, so I can prepare better for our meeting.
- Analysis ideas / research / methods
- Writing feedback
- Reading suggestions, content knowledge
- Administrative help
- Academic language and culture
- Peptalk / well-being
- Career planning
- Not much; the meeting is just to share an update
- ...

## Template to fill out _during_ meeting 

### Check-in
How are you doing? What's going on?

### Evaluation
1. Check if/which previous goals and deadlines were met, and which remain open (why?) 
    - Go over GitHub project and Project log
2. Are things generally going to everyone's satisfaction? _[discuss explicitly every few months]_

### Action points 
Can be with or without estimated (self-imposed) deadlines or ETA. Separate by priority. Clarify: idea or request?
- ...

_Ideally, we'll both take notes during our meeting. Please send them to me (as a reply to your original email) afterwards, so we're on the same page - and to fight any forgetfulness on my part!_

# Evaluation meetings
Once or twice a year, we'll zoom out together to see what's been done, what lies ahead, what works well and what doesn't: accomplishments and challenges in the past 6 months, plans for the next 6 months, personal goals and training needs, feedback on lab culture, mentorship, supervision and conduct.

For instance:
- Are you happy with the way things are going - scientifically, personally (work-life harmony), in the department and in the lab?
- What have you accomplished? Does this match your original plans?
- What did you struggle with?
- What works well, and what can we improve, in our mentoring relationship and in our lab culture? 
- Do you have/need a constellation of different mentors to advise you on different goals/aspects of your life and career?
- What are your goals for the next few months or year? Where do you see yourself in a few years?
- Did you take sufficient vacation days?

Also, please bring a (tentative) authorship contribution table for all projects/papers you are working on (see guidelines on the wiki). This way, we can discuss and make sure everyone on the project is on the same page.

Feedback for me:
- What is one thing I'm doing that I could do better? One thing I'm doing that's getting in my own way?

During these meetings, we will update and revise our [mentoring agreement](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/MentoringAgreement.html).
