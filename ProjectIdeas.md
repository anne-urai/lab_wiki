### Publicly available data sets
My motto: if you can answer a question with existing data, why collect it anew?
- [Here](https://nivlab.github.io/opendata/) is a link to a large database of behavioral datasets.
- [Here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0813-1) is a paper describing a [database](https://osf.io/s46pr/) of >145 confidence datasets.
- [This paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322318300295#sec1) describes a perceptual decision making task with psychopathology questionnaires, dataset [here](https://github.com/metacoglab/RouaultSeowGillanFleming).
- _See [here](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/IBLdata.html) for some examples on getting started with existing IBL data_.
