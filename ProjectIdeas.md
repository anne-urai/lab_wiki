Some ideas for project topics and research questions.

### Decision-making: data analysis
_See [here](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/IBLdata.html) for some examples on getting started with existing IBL data_.
- Does choice history bias correlate with psychopathology? Reanalyse data from [Rouault et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.12.017) by fitting models of choice history bias (e.g. [logistic m odels](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14637) or [drift diffusion models](http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.46331)).
- How do decision-making strategies (such as perseverance) change with ageing? Fit behavioral models (e.g. [Ashwood et al. 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-01007-z), [Findling et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-019-0518-9)) to decision-making data across the lifespan (both mice and humans).
- Do learning and decision-making vary with the biological clock, and is it easier to learn when consistently practicing at the same time of day? Potential collaboration with [Christian Tudorache](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/christian-tudorache#tab-1).
- How can we disentangle choice updating from slow drifts in decision criterion? Apply method proposed by [Gupta and Brody](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.17.460767v1).

### Decision-making: data collection
- How do decision-making strategies differ across mammalian species? Build and run a human version of the [IBL decision task](https://elifesciences.org/articles/63711), online and/or in the lab with EEG. 
- Are choice history biases consistent across different decision-making tasks, and over time?
- Can zebrafish learn the same decision-making tasks as mice and humans? Collaboration with [Christian Tudorache](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/christian-tudorache#tab-1).

### Literature review
- How do different types of neural noise (measured with fMRI, EEG or cellular recordings) change with ageing?
- The role of posterior parietal cortex in history-dependent choice biases.

### Climate action
- What type of messaging is most effective to mobilize people into climate actions?
- How can we improve virtual conferences and meetings to  make them a better replacement for in-person events?
- What is the carbon footprint of neuroscience data? Potential collaboration with [Charlotte Rae](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p220408-charlotte-rae).
- How can we best visualize uncertainty to communicate the urgency of the climate crisis?

### Random
- Replicate [academic family tree clustering](http://www.nature.com/news/majority-of-mathematicians-hail-from-just-24-scientific-families-1.20491) using [Neurotree](https://twitter.com/AnneEUrai/status/769270998965321728).
